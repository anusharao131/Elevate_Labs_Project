# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker by Sector

This project provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor global CO₂ emissions across **energy**, **transport**, and **industry** sectors, highlighting emission patterns by country, per capita, and per GDP metrics.

## 📊 Objective

To visualize and analyze carbon emissions globally in order to:

- Track emissions by **sector** (Energy, Transport, Industry)
- Identify **top emitting countries**
- Assess **CO₂ per capita** and **CO₂ per GDP** metrics
- Provide insights for **policy intervention and sustainability goals**

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python** – for data cleaning and metric calculations  
- **Excel** – for data structuring  
- **Tableau** – for interactive dashboard creation  

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Top Emitters**: China, USA, India are the highest contributors to CO₂ emissions
- **Sector Analysis**: The **energy sector** accounts for the majority of emissions globally
- **CO₂ Per Capita**: Fossil-fuel rich nations with smaller populations (e.g., Qatar, Kuwait) show high per capita emissions
- **CO₂ Per GDP**: Developing nations like **Kuwait** and **North Korea** exhibit higher emissions per unit of economic output

## 📈 Dashboard Features

- Total CO₂ emissions by country  
- CO₂ emissions trend over time  
- Sector-wise CO₂ breakdown  
- Emissions per capita and per GDP  
- Top 10 highest emitting countries 

## 📄 Deliverables

- ✅ Tableau Dashboard  
- ✅ [Policy Brief (PDF)]
