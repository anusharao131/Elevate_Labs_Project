# Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker by Sector

This project visualizes and analyzes global CO₂ emissions data by country and sector to support data-driven climate action.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard titled **"Worldwide CO₂ Emissions Monitor"** includes the following visual insights:

1. **Total CO₂ Emissions by Country**  
   - Highlights countries like China, the U.S., and India as top emitters.

2. **CO₂ Emissions Trend Over Time**  
   - Shows global GHG emissions growth from 1992 to 2020.

3. **CO₂ Emissions by Sector**  
   - Breaks down emissions by energy, transport, and industry.

4. **CO₂ Emissions per Capita by Country**  
   - Identifies countries like Qatar and Kuwait with high per capita emissions.

5. **CO₂ Emissions per GDP by Country**  
   - Shows emissions intensity relative to economic output.

6. **Top 10 Highest Emitting Countries**  
   - Ranks the countries contributing most to global emissions.
  ## 📁 Project Structure

**Policy Brief.pdf** – Summarizes key insights and recommendations.
**README.md** – Overview and documentation of the project.
**Tableau Dashboard** – Interactive visualizations for emissions analysis.

## 🔧 Tools Used

**Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
**Tableau** – Data visualization
**Microsoft Word & Excel** – Report and data formatting

## 📌 Key Findings

-The **Energy sector** is the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions globally.
-**China, U.S., and India** are the top emitters.
- High **CO₂ per capita** in countries with small populations but high fossil fuel usage.
- Higher **CO₂ per GDP** in emerging economies signals lower energy efficiency.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Promote decarbonization in energy and transport sectors.
- Support low-emission technologies, especially in developing countries.
- Enhance international collaboration to address emissions from major polluters.
